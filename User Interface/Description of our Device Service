Overview of a device service controller:

This device controller will communicate with the EdgeX REST Device Service.

Command to control the Matter device will come in through REST.

The REST device service will then send that command to the new .CPP EdgeX Matter Controller we created.

That controller will communicate to the Matter Hub.


Overview of our device sesrvice controller implementation:

Our device service controller makes it simpler to take care of indoor plants.

It utilizies matter compatible devices. 

Once you connect these matter compatible devices, you can control the humidity in certain rooms,
control the temperature, and control the amount of light the plants receive.

The user can control all these settings on their phone via the device service controller.

The matter compatible devices specific to this device service controller we implemented are: 
Smart Shades/Blinds and Smart Thermostat/Heating equipment
