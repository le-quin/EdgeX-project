A Walkthrough of the Mock User Interface Video

First, we are greeted by the launch screen for the application. It has the associatative logo and the name of the app.

Once you click upon the logo you are taken to the homescreen of the application. 

Upon it we see a drop down menu that houses the "Go Back", "Profile", "Home", "Notifications", and "Setting" Buttons.

Upon the homescreen we also see a list of rooms you have created previously as well as a button to add a new room. 

Once you click on the Add button you are prompted with questions and options for your new room.
The name of the room, what plants are housed in this room, and the matter compatable devices in the room.
Once you have made your selections you click the submit button, and the new room is added to the list of rooms on the homescreen.

You are also able to edit any rooms. You can edit what matter devices are utilized within the room, the plants within the room, 
and the name of the room. 

Since you are not able to upload videos on github, I have added a new file called Device Service Controller Video Demo
to the User Interface folder. To view it you can download the raw file.
