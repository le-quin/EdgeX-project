# EdgeX-project
For the Intel EdgeX coding competition, this repo will hold the code for our device service microservice.

Current Ideas:
-Connecting Smart Shades/Blinds, Smart Thermostat/Heating equipment, and Smart Water Controller to make it simpler to take care of indoor plants. The user can control all these setting on their phone and maybe get alerts when the plant may be in danger (according to their own specifications, getting too much sun, or underwatered, etc.). Too ambitious to connect it to a database or to automate it, but these concepts can be expanded on later.
-Connecting Smart Home Sensors, Smart Cameras, Smart Home Controllers, and Smart Door Locks to create a more centralized home security system.
-Connecting Smart Lights and Smart Speakers to sync music with the lights. (Need to flesh this idea out more to pursue it).

Deliverable is due August 7th!
