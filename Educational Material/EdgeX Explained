Edge Computing:
  -is essentially the middleman between IOT devices and the cloud
  -brings computation and data storage closer to the source of data, essentially completing these operations at the "edge"
  -by bringing data closer to the source, it is a very effective emerging technology that improves speed and security

The Matter Protocol Specification:
  -is essentially a standardized language for Smart Home Devices
  -using this specification, devices from any company can "talk" to each other
  -promotes a much more integrated home that does not require only buying from one company

How EdgeX utilizes these:
  -creates services at the edge to connect IOT devices to their larger server
  -uses Matter in its implementation
